# MCME-ChunkAnalysis 
is a tool to analyse and replace blocks on very large areas of a minecraft map. 
An analyse or replacement job is divided into small tasks which can be executed by the server without lagging.
Areas up to 2 billion blocks were tested, but there is no practical limitation of size.
Current working position and results are stored in a database. In case of a server reboot (even a very sudden crash) a job is
continued where it was interrupted.
